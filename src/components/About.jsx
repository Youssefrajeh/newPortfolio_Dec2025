                        I am a dedicated software developer with a unique background in
                        Applied Chemistry and extensive experience in quality control,
                        production management, and team leadership. Currently pursuing an
                        Advanced Diploma in Computer Programming and Analysis at Fanshawe
                        College with an impressive 3.9 GPA.

                        My diverse professional journey spans over 15 years in the chemical
                        and manufacturing industries across Syria and Cameroon, where I
                        developed strong analytical thinking, problem-solving skills, and
                        attention to detail. These transferable skills now drive my passion
                        for creating efficient, scalable software solutions.
